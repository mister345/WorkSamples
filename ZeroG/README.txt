This is a simple 2D overhead free-space racing demo that I wrote in c++ for Win 32.
I owe Chili as well as numerous online sources for the instruction and background that allowed me to create this demo. 

It features simple thrust/momentum physics, and circular collision detection physics 
based on Cohen Sutherland algorithms, as well as raster rotation to rotate and draw
the space ship, and vertex triangle mesh based drawing to create the map boundaries,
all built from scratch. The camera follows the spaceship around the level. It runs on a 
framewok that uses DirectX 9 via simple PutPixel functionality to draw on the screen. 

Later, I plan to expand it into more robust applications, with a functioning race
track, weapons, split screen support, and other features.
