3D MODEL BINARY CONVERTER

Purpose:  This is a console application designed to read and parse 3D models in the     
                popular .obj format and output them as a custom .BinaryMesh file format,      
                and as a simple .txt file containing lists of vertices, indices, and normal values for use 
                with my 3D game engine.									    
                Output file formats are .BinaryMesh and .txt. The BinaryMesh format was created because 
                it makes for much faster loading of 3D meshes into the main game engine.
 																	
Note:	This is a work in progress and still needs to be made more robust in order to	
                handle .obj files that whose vertex and index lists have been arranged        
	differently. For example, extra spaces, or different numbers of vertices/     
	indices/normals per line can throw off the parser. Also, it still has trouble 
	handling lists of quadrilaterals and n-gons, and currently only handles       
	triangle lists correctly.														
																								
Input:       Copy and paste or directly type file names into the console window.		    
																							    
Output:	Will produce TWO files, a custom txt and a .BinaryMesh file.				    
	Output file name is model.BinaryMesh and model.txt						    
                                                                                              
Requirements: Latest Visual C++ compiler recommended.
