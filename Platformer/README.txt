This is a simple 2D sidescrolling platformer demo I wrote in c++ for Win 32.
I owe Chili as well as numerous online sources for the background that allowed 
me to create this demo. It runs on a framewok that uses DirectX 9 via simple 
PutPixel functionality to draw on the screen. The camera follows the animated 
sprite as he jumps around the level. Later, I plan to expand it into more robust
applications, with level progression and other full-fledged features.
