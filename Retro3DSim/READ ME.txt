This is a Windows desktop application designed to render simple wireframe
shapes and apply the appropriate transformations to display them on screen
with the illusion of real life perspective. It was created primarily to
brush up pn core concepts of linear algebra, matrix math, and 3D simulation.

In the current implementation, only a tetrahedron, the simplest 3D polyhedron
possible, can be rendered. The simple PutPixel function was based on the chili
framework, for placing a single pixel of a specified RGB color at a given
coordinate in screen space. Everything else has been hand coded on top of this
simple function. Because this is not taking advantage of DirectX's true
rendering capabilities, not surprisingly, it runs incredibly slow and is not
suited for creating a graphics intensive 3D game. However, it is useful to
show the inner workings of 3D rendering.
