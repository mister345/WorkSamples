This is a bird's eye view adventure game demo, akin to the 
original Legend of Zelda for NES, written from scratch in C# for 
the Windows Forms platform. It is a turn-based 'dungeon' game 
in which the player collects a new weapon each level and attacks 
enemies in order to advance to the next level. Enemies may also 
attack or flee, based on their varying attributes.
