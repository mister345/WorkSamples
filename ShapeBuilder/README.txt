This is a basic exercise in initializing DirectX 12 in Win32
(a lengthy process in itself) and using it to read a simple
3D shape from a list of vertices and corresponding indices
in a txt file and display it on screen. The shape can be 
rotated via the mouse and zoomed in and out using the
mouse wheel. It can be replaced with any shape if the 
appropriate vertices and indices are written into the txt file.

This project is mainly based on material learned in Frank Luna's book, 
'Introduction to 3d Game Programming with DirectX 12' and will later be
expanded into a full FPS framework.
